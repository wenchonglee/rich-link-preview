This web app is first and foremost an exploratory project for me to try:

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)

  - Experience the toolchain
  - Discovering limitations of server-side rendering

- [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/)

  - How do popular messaging apps (e.g. Slack, Telegram) serve previews of links?

- Learning more CSS

  - This project was an excuse to run through this [Google IO Workshop](https://github.com/argyleink/Google-IO-2021-Workshop_User-Adaptive-Interfaces)

## Unresolved Limitations

- Cannot hit websites that isn't server rendered (e.g. twitter)
